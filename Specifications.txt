Login Screen

The first screen of your system should provide options for members to login
and for new members to register. Existing members should be able to login
using a valid email and password, denoted with email and pwd in table
members. Proper messages should be given if the provided email is not
unique.

Members should be able to logout and there must be also an option to exit
the program.

GUI Requirements:
1. Exit Button
2. Login field
3. Password field
4. Button to create register screen
5. Button to confirm login (check Username and password)
    - Then move to Main screen
6. Text telling user what to do


After a login, all unseen messages of the member will be displayed,
and the status of the messages will be set to seen (i.e, the seen column is
set to 'y'). Unregistered members should be able to sign up by providing a
unique email, a name, a phone, and a password. After a successful login or
signup, members should be able to perform the subsequent operations
(possibly chosen from a menu) as discussed next.
